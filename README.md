This is a go project created to explore the minifrabric application of hyperledger. Its a very interesting tool that allows easy deploys of blockchain to a defined network. This project consists of a wand creation
scheme, where suppliers can offer their materials and wandMakers can buy these materials and transform them into wands, allowing them to sell. The general concept is to be able to create structs and pass them from
one user to another.
